# Extention of the IFSPEC Benchmark

This repository stores an extention of the JavaSource IFSPEC Benchmark set.
Judgements are stored in YAML-files.
The YAML-files for ```securibench-micro``` are created by the ```securibench-micro/generate-svcomp-benchmarks.sh```.

The original benchmark set can be found [here](www.spp-rs3.de/IFSpec).
We provide a ```verifier-stub``` package on [Github](https://github.com/tudo-aqua/verifier-stub).
